# Chat_Application-Java

This is a basic two-user chat application built using Java Sockets for networking and Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application mimics the behavior of simple messaging platforms like WhatsApp — when a message is sent from one window, it appears in the other in real-time.

📌 Features

🖥️ GUI-based chat using Java Swing

🔌 Socket-based communication between client and server

💬 Real-time message exchange between two windows

📚 Beginner-friendly project to understand networking and GUI programming in Java

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Java Swing for building the GUI
